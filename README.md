## Project Objective

This project is part of my manual QA practice while preparing for the ISTQB Foundation Level certification.

Here I document:
- Exploratory testing
- Structured test cases
- Bug reports with screenshots
- Application of test design techniques from the ISTQB syllabus:
  - Equivalence Partitioning
  - Decision Table Testing
  - (Also tried Boundary Value Analysis but it did not apply)

All tests were done manually using a Firefox browser on Windows 11.
